# CHAOS-PRESENCE-IN-DISCRETE-ENVIRONMENTS
Chaos and unpredictability are inherent fields of society, economics, biology, engineering and philosophy. It is also observable by any individual, composing both attractive events, such as fractals and complexity in scenarios, as problematic such as unpredictability in the economy. This study aims to better observe and interpret the formation of these complex behaviors, namely order, organization and chaos, based on routines and definitions considered basic in the programming topic. For this purpose, codes were used for simulations that present some sensitivity to variables for each generation, taking into consideration some propositions about the nature of chaos, notably how simple events can present complex chaotic behaviors. At the end of the study, the presence of chaos, unpredictability, and order windows were found, relating the formation of simulated particles with behaviors observed in nature, through images and videos, and through graphics, extracting the positions of particles by time. Chaos and unpredictability were observed in the simulation, even with basic level codes, fostering propositions about the theory and making it more tangent for future developments.
